# nati.vim

This is a set of defaults to mixin with your vimrc and other plugins (maybe
vim-sensible) to tailor things to the nati coding convention.

## Installation

Recommendation: Use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). It
makes life easy. I was a doubter but now believe in it.

Once pathogen is setup, simply run these commands:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim # not required but recommended
    git clone git://github.com/epage/vim-nati.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-nati

## Features

So far we just set the indentation rules and pre-configure ctrlp.  Everything
else should be a part of your regular configuration.

## FAQ

If you have questions, just look at
[vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)'s documentation. This was
modeled after it anyways.
